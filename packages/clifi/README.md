### Installation

To install clifi, you need to have Node.js (version 12 or higher) installed on your system. You can install clifi using npm or yarn:

bashCopy code

`npm install clifi

# or

yarn add clifi`

Save to grepper

### Usage

To use clifi, you can follow these basic steps, inferred from the `cli.ts` and `router.ts` files:

1. Define Routes: Utilize `router.ts` to define the routes for your CLI commands. Routes are mapped to specific command actions, making it easy to organize and understand the flow of your CLI application.
2. CLI Setup: With `cli.ts`, set up your CLI application by configuring commands, options, and their respective handlers. This file provides the infrastructure to parse command-line arguments and delegate them to the appropriate routes.

### Features

clifi provides a robust set of features for CLI development:

- Route-Based Command Handling: Inspired by web application routing, this approach allows for a clear and organized way to manage CLI commands and their actions.
- Easy Command and Option Configuration: `cli.ts` offers a straightforward API to define commands, options, and their callbacks, making the CLI application intuitive to develop and use.
- Interactive Prompts: Integration with libraries like `inquirer` (as suggested by dependencies) for gathering user input through interactive prompts.
- Elegant Terminal Feedback: Use of `ora` for terminal spinners, providing users with feedback during longer operations.
- Error Handling: `error.ts` indicates structured error handling mechanisms, ensuring your CLI can gracefully handle and report errors to the user.

### Configuration

The project appears to be configurable through its TypeScript files, with specific emphasis on:

- Custom Command Definitions: As seen in `cli.ts`, allowing for detailed customization of command behaviors, options, and handling logic.
- Error Customization: The `error.ts` file suggests the capability to define custom error messages or handling strategies, enhancing the user's understanding and troubleshooting capabilities.

### Configuration

The project includes a configuration for `commitizen` to help standardize commit messages. For custom configurations, refer to the specific sections in the TypeScript files for more details.
