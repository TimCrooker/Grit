# Update

## Update a specific generator

For instances where you would like to directly update a generator that you already installed and do nothing else you can use the `update` command with the name of the generator to update:

```bash
grit update <generator-name>
#generator-name: the name of the generator you want to run (required)
```

## Update all generators

If you want to update all of the generators on your machine then use the following command to install all availiable updates:

```bash
grit update --all
```

## Show a list of generators with updates availiable

To simply view a list of installed generators that have updates available then use the update command with no arguments or options:

```bash
grit update
```

This command will show the following screen where you can select generatos to update directly from the list
