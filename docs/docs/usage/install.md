# Install

Grit includes the `install` command which gives you multiple ways to quickly install new generators locally onto your machine.

## Install a known generator

If you already know what generator you would like to install then you can use the following command which simply installs it on your machine:

```bash
grit install <generator>
#generator: the name of the generator you want to run (required)
```

## Discover new generators

If you don't know what generator you want to run, you can use the `grit find` command to discover generators you can use:

```bash
grit find
```

Using this command will bring you to the following screen where you can browse a list of publically available generators ranked in order of popularity:
