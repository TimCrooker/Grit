# Find

## Search for generators

If you know a keyword of a generator type you are looking for but don't know the exact name of it, you can use the `find` command with a search term to search for generators:

```bash
grit find <search-term>
```

This command will either find no generators matching the search query, or will show the following screen where you can select any generators from the list to install them
