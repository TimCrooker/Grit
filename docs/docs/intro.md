# Introduction

⚡️ Grit will help you build **production-ready projects faster**

🎯 Writing boilerplate code sucks. Instead, **focus on your core project** and use Grit generators to scaffold out configs and utilities.

❌ Eliminate repetitive tasks and **Never write the same code twice** by creating your own Grit generators in **seconds**

🏭 Grit is a **scaffolding tool** built to speed up a developers workflow through the use of **reusable code generators**. Grit generators are run in the command line with the **Grit CLI** where they can ask users questions and use answers to **perform file manipulations** accordingly. Generators have access to a libray of useful methods that allow them to perform **nearly any task**, so there is no limit to what Grit can do.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
