# Introduction

⚡️ Grit will help you build **production-ready projects faster**

🎯 Writing boilerplate code sucks. Instead, **focus on your core project** and use Grit generators to scaffold out configs and utilities.

❌ Eliminate repetitive tasks and **Never write the same code twice** by creating your own Grit generators in **seconds**

🏭 Grit is a **scaffolding tool** built to speed up a developers workflow through the use of **reusable code generators**. Grit generators are run in the command line with the **Grit CLI** where they can ask users questions and use answers to **perform file manipulations** accordingly. Generators have access to a libray of useful methods that allow them to perform **nearly any task**, so there is no limit to what Grit can do
