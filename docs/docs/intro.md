# Introduction

⚡️ Grit will help you build **production-ready projects faster**

🎯 Writing boilerplate code sucks. Instead, **focus on your core project** and use Grit generators to scaffold configs and integrations.

❌ Eliminate repetitive tasks and **Never write the same code twice** by creating your own generators in **seconds**

😎 Discover some popular [Grit generators](https://google.com) to speed up anyone's workflow

🏭 Grit is a **scaffolding tool** built to speed up a developers workflow through the use of **reusable code generators**. Grit generators are run in the command line with the **Grit CLI** where they gather information from users to **perform file manipulations**. Generators have access to a libray of useful methods that allow them to perform **nearly any task**, so there is no limit to what Grit can do

## Motivation

Grit was built out of my own painful developer experiance creating multiple web applications. I found quite quickly that much of the work i was doing to begin a new project was tedious boilerplate building and configuring developer tooling. It is not uncommon for this work to take many days if not weeks to setup and test: All of this before a single line of business logic was typed.

> Searching for a solution to this issue left me very unsatisfied and hungry for a truly elegant solution

- **Most Templates/Boilerplates suck**
  - Dependencies become oudated quickly
  - Vulerabilities and incompatibilies
  - Bad or inefficient application architecture
  - Not optimised for getting to production
  - Too many or too few features
  - Even good ones require extensive customization

After lots of research and testing i found that modularity is likely the solution to these issues as it allows for assembly of the project skeleton through composition of many individually maintained and decoupled plugins. Discovering that scaffolding tools were the perfect solution i was unimpressed with the implimentations already out there as they either lacked features or were too complicated to develop for

- Yeoman Generators are too complicated to create
  - creates barrier to entry and lack of community engagement and new generators
